# Fisk_MississippiRiver_shapefiles
Shapefiles created from Harold Fisk maps of the historical locations of the Mississippi River (included years: 1820, 1880, 1944, 2019)

These maps were drawn in 1944.  Maps can be found at:

Maps were georeferenced using the WGS 84/ UTM Zone 15N projection.  The river location was vectorized by hand.

Note: The 2019 shapefile is not from Fisk, rather QuickMapServices, however, may be useful as it was created in same method as the other years for dataset continuity.
